Hi everyone,
It’s been a while, but I’m very happy to share some good news today:
the J-Play app is now open-source and the full source code is available here.
This means anyone can download it, explore the code, and even improve it — keeping the spirit of J-Play alive and evolving within the community of J-Players.
It took quite some time to secure approval from the authorities, but I truly believe this was the best path forward to ensure that all J-Players can continue making music with their devices. And now, it’s done!
You can also grab precompiled versions here:
- J-Play for Mac (Apple Silicon & Intel)
- J-Play for Windows

Let’s keep making music together!
